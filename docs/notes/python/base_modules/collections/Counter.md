# Counter

Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects:

```python
>>> c = Counter() # a new, empty counter
>>> c
Counter()
>>> c = Counter('gallahad') # a new counter from an iterable
>>> c
Counter({'a': 3, 'l': 2, 'g': 1, 'h': 1, 'd': 1}) # a new counter from a mapping
>>> c = Counter({'red': 4, 'blue': 2}) # a new counter from a mapping
>>> c
Counter({'red': 4, 'blue': 2}) 
>>> c = Counter(cats=4, dogs=8) # a new counter from keyword args  
>>> c
Counter({'dogs': 8, 'cats': 4}) 
>>> Counter([1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4])
Counter({4: 4, 3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})
```

## Delete objects as shown below:

```python
# Delete records as shown below:
>>> c = Counter(['eggs', 'ham'])
>>> c
Counter({'eggs': 1, 'ham': 1})
>>> del c['ham']   
>>> c
Counter({'eggs': 1})
```

Counter objects support three methods beyond those available for all dictionaries:

## elements()

Return an iterator over elements repeating each as many times as its count. Elements are returned in arbitrary order. If an elementâ€™s count is less than one, elements() will ignore it.

```python
>>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)
>>> list(c.elements())

['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b']
```

## most_common([n])

Return a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least. If n is omitted or None, most_common() returns all elements in the counter. Elements with equal counts are ordered arbitrarily:

```python
>>> Counter('abracadabra').most_common(3)
[('a', 5), ('r', 2), ('b', 2)]
```

## subtract([iterable-or-mapping])

Elements are subtracted from an iterable or from another mapping (or counter). Like dict.update() but subtracts counts instead of replacing them. Both inputs and outputs may be zero or negative.

```python
>>> c = Counter(a=4, b=2, c=0, d=-2)
>>> d = Counter(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4)
>>> c.subtract(d)
>>> c
Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 0, 'c': -3, 'd': -6})
```
