# Computer Vision

## What Is Computer Vision

Provide computers the ability to see and understand images.


## Why use Computer Vision

To automate many tasks in many industries based on images:

* Automotive
* Food and Beverage
* Medical
* Etc.


## Applications of Computer Vision

What about sifting through videos? Have you ever tried looking for particular scene of a movie and had to to fast forward to skip around until you could find it? What about your own videos? What if they could be searchable? IBM created an example of how you could do this by tagging videos with keywords based on the objects that appear in each scene.

Basically examples of many images of things like powerlines and house damage to identify rust and or hail damage for insurance companies.


## Recent Research in Computer Vision

* Object detection
  * To make meaningful inferences in videos, this needs to be completed as a first step. 
* Image to image translation
  * Summer to winter
  * horse to zebra
* Motion transfer between subject like dance moves


## Brainstorming Your Own Applications

Medicine:
* Training doctors to accurately detect cancer takes years of education and experience.

Driving:
* Driving requires constant focused visual attention and accidents can be life-threatening.
* Drivers are prone to distraction and long-distance drivers are prone to falling asleep.

Security:
* Looking for suspect across hours of footage consumes lots of time.
* Detecting dangerous goods in x-rays at the airport is difficult and requires significant training and focused attention.

Manufacturing:
* Defect detection in manufactured goods.
* Employees are not using safetly helmets or equipment despite strict regulations.
