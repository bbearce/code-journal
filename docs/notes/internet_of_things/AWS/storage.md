# Storage

> In my quest to get started with AWS, I noticed lots of different storage types. I'll make some quick notes about them here.


**EC2** – Elastic Compute Cloud – The VMs  
While not storage, EC2 instances are the basis for anything in AWS
 
**EBS** – Elastic Block Storage - $$ - Can be scaled but upgrading costs money  
**S3** – Simple Storage Service – files and objects - $$  
**EFS** – Elastic File System -  - $$$  
**Glacier** – Low cost option for long term storage - $  

 
**AWS Snowball** - Snowball is designed to make such transfers easy without incurring astronomical network usage fees. 

**FSx for Lustre** - High performance computing for fast processing of workloads. Integrates with S3 and you pay as you go. 

**AWS Storage Gateway** - Seamlessly links your on-premises environment to Amazon cloud storage 

**Cloud Data Migration Services** - A portfolio of services to help simplify and accelerate moving data of all types and sizes into and out of the AWS cloud 

**AWS Backup** - Backups
