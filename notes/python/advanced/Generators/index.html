    <h1 id="generators">Generators</h1>
<p><strong>A simplified Iterator</strong></p>
<h2 id="quick-example">Quick Example:</h2>
<pre><code class="python">def all_even():
    n = 0
    while True:
        yield n
        n += 2

x = all_even()
print(next(x)) # 0
print(next(x)) # 2
print(next(x)) # 4
#.... forever
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-are-generators-in-python">What are generators in Python?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of overhead in building an iterator in Python; we have to implement a class with <strong>iter</strong>() and <strong>next</strong>() method, keep track of internal states, raise StopIteration when there was no values to be returned etc.</p>
<p>This is both lengthy and counter intuitive. Generator comes into rescue in such situations.</p>
<p>Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the overhead we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-generator-in-python">How to create a generator in Python?</h2>
<p>It is fairly simple to create a generator in Python. It is as easy as defining a normal function with yield statement instead of a return statement.</p>
<p>If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.</p>
<p>The difference is that, while a return statement terminates a function entirely, yield statement pauses the function saving all its states and later continues from there on successive calls.</p>
<h2 id="differences-between-generator-function-and-a-normal-function">Differences between Generator function and a Normal function</h2>
<ul>
<li>Generator function contains one or more yield statement.  </li>
<li>When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.  </li>
<li>Methods like <strong>iter</strong>() and <strong>next</strong>() are implemented automatically. So we can iterate through the items using next().  </li>
<li>Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.  </li>
<li>Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.  </li>
<li>Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Simple Example:</p>
<pre><code class="python"># A simple generator function
def my_gen():
    n = 1
    print('This is printed first')
    # Generator function contains yield statements
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed second')
    yield n

    n += 1
    print('This is printed at last')
    yield n

mg = my_gen()
next(mg) # This is printed first
next(mg) # This is printed second
next(mg) # This is printed third
next(mg) # Raises error...
</code></pre>

<p>One interesting thing to note in the above example is that, the value of variable n is remembered between each call.</p>
<p>Unlike normal functions, the local variables are not destroyed when the function yields. Furthermore, the generator object can be iterated only once.</p>
<p>To restart the process we need to create another generator object using something like a = my_gen().</p>
<p>Note: One final thing to note is that we can use generators with for loops directly.</p>
<p>This is because, a for loop takes an iterator and iterates over it using next() function. It automatically ends when StopIteration is raised. <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/iterator#for-loop-working">Check here to know how a for loop is actually implemented in Python</a>.</p>
<h2 id="python-generators-with-a-loop">Python Generators with a Loop</h2>
<p>The above example is of less use and we studied it just to get an idea of what was happening in the background.</p>
<p>Normally, generator functions are implemented with a loop having a suitable terminating condition.</p>
<p>Let's take an example of a generator that reverses a string.</p>
<pre><code class="python">def rev_str(my_str):
    length = len(my_str)
    for i in range(length - 1,-1,-1):
        yield my_str[i]

# For loop to reverse the string
# Output:
# o
# l
# l
# e
# h
for char in rev_str(&quot;hello&quot;):
     print(char)
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we use range() function to get the index in reverse order using the for loop.</p>
<p>It turns out that this generator function not only works with string, but also with other kind of iterables like list, tuple etc.</p>
<h2 id="python-generator-expression">Python Generator Expression</h2>
<p>Simple generators can be easily created on the fly using generator expressions. It makes building generators easy.</p>
<p>Same as lambda function creates an anonymous function, generator expression creates an anonymous generator function.</p>
<p>The syntax for generator expression is similar to that of a list comprehension in Python. But the square brackets are replaced with round parentheses.</p>
<p>The major difference between a list comprehension and a generator expression is that while list comprehension produces the entire list, generator expression produces one item at a time.</p>
<p>They are kind of lazy, producing items only when asked for. For this reason, a generator expression is much more memory efficient than an equivalent list comprehension.</p>
<pre><code class="python"># Initialize the list
my_list = [1, 3, 6, 10]

# square each term using list comprehension
# Output: [1, 9, 36, 100]
[x**2 for x in my_list]

# same thing can be done using generator expression
# Output:  at 0x0000000002EBDAF8&gt;
y = (x**2 for x in my_list)

print(next(y)) # 1
print(next(y)) # 9
print(next(y)) # 36
print(next(y)) # 100
print(next(y)) # error
</code></pre>

<p>Generator expression can be used inside functions. When used in such a way, the round parentheses can be dropped.</p>
<pre><code class="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(x**2 for x in my_list)
146

&gt;&gt;&gt; max(x**2 for x in my_list)
100
</code></pre>

<h2 id="why-generators-are-used-in-python">Why generators are used in Python?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Easy to Implement:
Generators can be implemented in a clear and concise way as compared to their iterator class counterpart. Following is an example to implement a sequence of power of 2's using iterator class.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="python">class PowTwo:
    def __init__(self, max = 0):
        self.max = max

    def __iter__(self):
        self.n = 0
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.n &gt; self.max:
            raise StopIteration

        result = 2 ** self.n
        self.n += 1
        return result
</code></pre>

<p>This was lengthy. Now lets do the same using a generator function.</p>
<pre><code class="python">def PowTwoGen(max = 0):
    n = 0
    while n &lt; max:
        yield 2 ** n
        n += 1
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Memory Efficient:
A normal function to return a sequence will create the entire sequence in memory before returning the result. This is an overkill if the number of items in the sequence is very large.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generator implementation of such sequence is memory friendly and is preferred since it only produces one item at a time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Represent Infinite Stream:
Generators are excellent medium to represent an infinite stream of data. Infinite streams cannot be stored in memory and since generators produce only one item at a time, it can represent infinite stream of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following example can generate all the even numbers (at least in theory).</p>
<pre><code class="python">def all_even():
    n = 0
    while True:
        yield n
        n += 2
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Pipelining Generators:
Generators can be used to pipeline a series of operations. This is best illustrated using an example.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we have a log file from a famous fast food chain. The log file has a column (4th column) that keeps track of the number of pizza sold every hour and we want to sum it to find the total pizzas sold in 5 years.</p>
<p>Assume everything is in string and numbers that are not available are marked as 'N/A'. A generator implementation of this could be as follows.</p>
<pre><code class="python">#  - sells.log - #
# 1 2 3 1
# 1 2 3 2
# 1 2 3 3
# 1 2 3 4
# 1 2 3 5
# 1 2 3 6
# 1 2 3 7
# 1 2 3 8
# 1 2 3 9
# 1 2 3 10
#  -           - #


with open('sells.log') as file:
    pizza_col = (line.split()[3] for line in file) 
    per_hour = (int(x) for x in pizza_col if x != 'N/A')
    print(&quot;Total pizzas sold = &quot;,sum(per_hour))

</code></pre>

<p>This pipelining is efficient and easy to read (and yes, a lot cooler!).</p>
